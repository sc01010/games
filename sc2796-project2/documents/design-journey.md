# Project 2: Design Journey

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


## Design Plan

### Describe your Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your collection be about?
> What types of attributes will you keep track of for the *things* in your catalog? 1-2 sentences.

* My collection will be about games. I will be creating a table with a list of different types of games. I will be using Steam to find games to include in my collection.
* In my catalog, I will be mainly keeping track of TEXT. I plan on including the titles of the games, company that created the games, genre of the games, rating of the games, price of the games, and whether a game is multiplayer or single player. Additionally, I think that only the primary key will be using the INTEGER type.

### Audiences (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audiences. Be specific and justify why each audience is appropriate for your site.
> You are required to have **two** audiences. One to view the catalog. The other inserts records into the catalog.

Viewer: My site's viewers are gamers who are trying to find a new game to play. I did not specify a specific age for the gamer audience of my website because gamers can be of all ages. On my website, I am going to be including a assortment of games, so that my audience can have a diverse groups of games to choose from. Additionally, when I use the word gamers, I mean anyone who plays games. My website contains information about other games, so that gamers can come and find a list of new games that they can try.

Inserts New Records: The people who insert records into the catalog are game companies who are trying to advertize their game. Game companies is an appropriate new record inserting audience for my website, because game companies want their games to sell, and in order to sell more games, they need to let more people know about their games. My web site is a community where gamers can gather and learn about new games, so it is perfect for game companies to spread awareness about their games.


### Personas (Milestone 1)
> Your personas must have a name and a "depiction". This can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> There is no required format for the persona.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona. Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
> Your personas should focus on the goals, obstacles, and factors that influence behavior of each audience.

> Persona for your "viewer" audience:

![Sketch of William Brown](/documents/william_brown.JPG)
This is William Brown, my "viewer" audience


> Persona for your "inserts new records" audience:

![Sketch of Kenji Takahashi](/documents/kenji_takahashi.JPG)
This is Kenji Takahashi, my "insert new records" audience


### Site Design (Milestone 1)
> Document your _entire_ design process. **We want to see iteration!**
> Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to the final design you plan to implement (sketch).
> Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation, if applicable (card sorting).
> Plan your URLs for the site.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each design artifact. Explain what the artifact is, how it meets the goals of your personas (**refer to your personas by name**).
> Clearly label the final design.

![Sketch of the first iteration of my web site](/documents/first_iteration.JPG)
This is the first iteration of my web site.
In this iteration of my website, after I finished my sketch, I realized that I should not have sketched using a vertical layout because most of the video games that are going to be featured on my web site are going to be desktop video games, so it would make more sense to sketch my web site using a horizontal layout, because as I have learned from INFO 1300, desktops have a wider screen size. This meets the need of William because he needs a web site where he can find different kinds of games that he can play on his free time. This web site meets the need of William because he needs a web site where he can find different kinds of games that he can play on his free time. William also need to know about the creators and name of the games, so that he can look up the games/creators to learn more about them. Through the names of the games and authors, William can also see whether he has played any similar games (he may be attracted to previous versions of the game or games of the same creator). My site also meets the needs of Kenji because he is trying to advertise the games for the company that he works with. My web site has a feature where companies can insert their "new games" into the tables, so that users that visits my web site can see those games and potentially download and play those games.

![Sketch of the second iteration of my web site](/documents/second_iteration.JPG)
This is the third iteration of my web site.
In this iteration of my web site, I have sketched my web site in the horizontal layout. I have the name of my web site on the very top of the page. I have a main and a aside element to separate the filter from the main content of the page. I have the different boxes that represents the 10 different games that I am going to have featured on my web site. I have also included the search bar in the top of my main element, so that my users can more easily search for the game that they may be looking for. This web site meets the need of William because he needs a web site where he can find different kinds of games that he can play on his free time. William also need to know about the creators and name of the games, so that he can look up the games/creators to learn more about them. Through the names of the games and authors, William can also see whether he has played any similar games (he may be attracted to previous versions of the game or games of the same creator). My site also meets the needs of Kenji because he is trying to advertise the games for the company that he works with. My web site has a feature where companies can insert their "new games" into the tables, so that users that visits my web site can see those games and potentially download and play those games.

![Sketch of the third iteration of my web site](/documents/third_iteration.JPG)
This is the third iteration of my web site.
In this iteration of my web site, I have come to the realization that when I was visiting Amazon, they have the search bar on the very top of their page. This made me think rethink about having my search bar at the topic of the main element in my page, because I realized that by having the search bar at the very top of my web site, William would have a much more easier time with finding and using the search bar. William will see the search bar the second that he comes onto the web site, because the search bar is at the very top of the page, thus if he has a game on the top of his head, he can enter it into the search bar right away. This web site meets the need of William because he needs a web site where he can find different kinds of games that he can play on his free time. William also need to know about the creators and name of the games, so that he can look up the games/creators to learn more about them. Through the names of the games and authors, William can also see whether he has played any similar games (he may be attracted to previous versions of the game or games of the same creator). My site also meets the needs of Kenji because he is trying to advertise the games for the company that he works with. My web site has a feature where companies can insert their "new games" into the tables, so that users that visits my web site can see those games and potentially download and play those games.

![Sketch of the fourth iteration of my web site](/documents/fourth_iteration.JPG)
This is the fourth iteration of my web site.
As I was looking through web sites for inspiration (Professor Harms taught us in lecture that it is a good idea to find things that have worked on other web sites, because those element have been tested over and over already), I came to realize that a lot of these sites have the filters on the very left side of their web site. This made me rethink about where I want to have the filter of my web site, because thinking about William, I came to realize that if he would use the filter on the web site, he is most likely to use filter first before looking through the items on the web site, because using the filter means that he already has a sense of what kinds of games he is looking for. That is the reason why in this iteration, I have decided to put the aside element on the left side and the main element on the right side. This web site meets the need of William because he needs a web site where he can find different kinds of games that he can play on his free time. William also needs to find games where he can play with his friends and under the price of $30 because he is on a budget. Additionally, he has a younger brother that he shares a room with, so he also needs to avoid games that are obscene. On this web site, I have included a table that contains the minimum age rating of games, price of games, and also information about whether a game is single player or multiplayer. Additionally, my site also contains information about the names of the games and the creators of the games, because he needs a web site where he can find different kinds of games that he can play on his free time. William also need to know about the creators and name of the games, so that he can look up the games/creators to learn more about them. Through the names of the games and authors, William can also see whether he has played any similar games (he may be attracted to previous versions of the game or games of the same creator). My site also meets the needs of Kenji because he is trying to advertise the games for the company that he works with. My web site has a feature where companies can insert their "new games" into the tables, so that users that visits my web site can see those games and potentially download and play those games.

![Sketch of the fifth iteration of my web site](/documents/fifth_iteration.JPG)
This is the fifth iteration of my web site.
In this iteration of my website, I basically had everything that I have had in the fourth iteration of my web site, but I also included the form that Kenji can use to add a new game to the table of games. This form in turn meets the needs of Kenji, because he works on the advertizement team of a game company and he is responsible for attracting more users to the game, thus he needs able to present the work of his company. With the form, now Kenji can just fill out the form to add a new record onto the table, and the users who visits my web site can see check out the game. The form meets the needs of  Kenji because using the form, Kenji can fill out the information about the game that he is trying to advertize (title of the game, company name, multi/single player, genre, price, and minimum age rating). With the form, users like William, that visits my website can get a first impression of the game. I decided to include the form under the filter instead of beneath the table, because as the table gets bigger and bigger, the form might get drown out and this may make it harder for Kenji to locate and fill out the form. Since the filter is going to be fixated, it would make more sense to include the form beneath the filter, so that Kenji can more easily access the form.

![Sketch of the final iteration of my web site](/documents/final_iteration.JPG)
This is the final iteration of my web site.
In this iteration of my website, In addition to everything that I have before (please refer to the previous description that I have written about the previous iterations of this sketch because this sketch is a build off of the previous sketches), in this iteration of my sketch, I have included all of the error messages that needs to be included. The error messages are for the form components when the user's inputs are not valid/when the user leaves the form control blank. I have also included the hidden message in this sketch for when the user successfully submits the form. The message is thanking users like Kenji for inserting a new record into the table of games. There is the header that contains the search bar and the logo of the website. There is the filtering and form for adding a new record on the left side of the web site. There is the table on the right side of the website. There is also the footer that contains my contact information, in case a user has some trouble with the website and needs to reach me. I also decided to remove the alternating record color pattern because I realized that using that pattern will only create more distraction in my table.

![Card Sorting of my web site](/documents/cardsorting.JPG)
This is the card sorting for my web site.
I have included the 10 games in this card sort, and I also included the filter and search bar. This reminds me of the element that I am going to be putting on my web site.

![Second Iteration of Card Sorting of my web site](/documents/cardsorting_second_iteration.JPG)
This is the card sorting for my web site.
I have included the 10 games in this card sort, and I also included the filter and search bar. In this iteration, I also included the form that is necessary so that Kenji has a place where he can add a new game to the table of games on the web site. One thing to note is that this is the initial set of 10 games that my website started out with. As I test the insert form of my website, this number is going to change.


I will not be including a navigation bar, because there is only need for one page. Looking at web sites like steam, there is a page that contains many games with a search bar and filter feature. I think that my web site is especially appropriate with only 1 page, because I only have 10 games that I am going to be including on my web site, it is unnecessary for my web site to span more than one page. My web site is meets the needs of William because there is a list of games on the web site that he can look through, and there is also the filter bar and search bar to make looking for games easier for William. Kenji will also be able to insert new records onto the table using the form that is located in the the aside element, so that user can have more games to look at.


In terms of the URLs of my web site, there is only going to be the homepage. The homepage in of itself is the search page.

### Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Write a one paragraph reflection explaining how you used the design patterns for online catalogs in your site's design.

In my web site's final design, I used alignment to make sure that my user's eyes is not zigzagging all over the place, because as we have learned from class, we can strain our users eyes if the content on our website is not easy to follow. I also use proximity so put more "breathing spaces" in my web site so that all of the content that is on my web site is not all jumbo together. In addition to adding enough spaces in my web site, I also removed the vertical lines in my table, because Professor Harms taught us that having those hard vertical lines in our tables will distract our users because as they move their eyes through the line of the table, their eyes will get caught every time by those lines. I also removed the horizontal lines for the same reason. Professor Harms taught us that instead of using lines to split up our the contents in the tables, we should be using spacing, because that makes our tables a lot more usable. Another suggestion that Professor Harms gave us was that we can use alternating colors in our tables to separate the content if it makes each record easier to see, because they will not have the same negative effects as hard lines, but will help with separating each record. I am also using alternating color in my website to divide up each record. I am also using hierarchy to make sure that my user can tell the difference between teh heading of my web site, and the title of each column in my web site. I don't want the user to be mixing up the contents vs the heading/title of my web site. I will be employing hierarchy in the sense of using the h1-h6 elements and the p element. I will also style of the contents differently than the headings using CSS.


## Implementation Plan

### Database Schema (Milestone 1)
> Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this. Make sure you include constraints for each field.

Table: games
- id: INTEGER {PK, U, NN, AI},
- title: TEXT {NN},
- company: TEXT {NN},
- multi_or_single: TEXT {NN},
- genre: TEXT {NN},
- price: REAL {NN},
- minimum_age_rating: INTEGER {NN}



### Database Query Plan (Milestone 1)
> Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.

1. All records

    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    ```

2. Insert record

    ```
    INSERT INTO games (title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating)
    VALUE (value1, value2, value3, value4, value5, value6);
    ```


3. Search records - when the user types something into the search bar, using wildcard to search all fields

    ```
    "SELECT * FROM games WHERE (title LIKE '%' || :userSearch || '%') OR
    (company LIKE '%' || :userSearch || '%') OR
    (genre LIKE '%' || :userSearch || '%') OR
    (price LIKE '%' || :userSearch || '%') OR
    (minimum_age_rating LIKE '%' || :userSearch || '%') OR
    (multi_or_single LIKE '%' || :userSearch || '%')";
    $sql_select_parameters= array(':userSearch' => $search_terms);
    ```


4.  Filtering games that only has multiplayer

    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (multi_or_single = 'multi');
    ```

5.  Filtering games that only has single player

    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (multi_or_single = 'single');
    ```

6.  Filtering games that only has both single and multiplayer

    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (multi_or_single = 'both');
    ```

7.  Filtering games that are less than $30

    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (price < 30.00);
    ```

8.  Filtering games that are free
    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (price = 0.0);
    ```

9.  Filtering games with age limit: 18 and older
    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (minimum_age_rating >= 18);
    ```

10. Filtering games with age limit: younger than 18
    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (minimum_age_rating < 18);
    ```

11. Filtering games with age limit: 14 and younger
    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (minimum_age_rating <= 14);
    ```

12. Filtering games with age limit: 10 and younger
    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (minimum_age_rating <= 10);
    ```

13. Filtering games with age limit: 6 and younger
    ```
    SELECT title, company, multi_or_single, genre, price, minimum_age_rating FROM games
    WHERE (minimum_age_rating <= 6);
    ```

### Code Planning (Milestone 2)
> Plan any PHP code you'll need here using pseudocode.
> Use this space to plan out your form validation and assembling the SQL queries, etc.

Form validation, inserting records into the database:
```
When the user submits the form:
  If the game title component data is valid:
    Hide the game title feedback message
  else:
    Show the game title feedback message (Please provide the name of the game)
  If the game title component data is unique:
    Hide the game title unique feedback message
  else:
    Show the game title unique feedback message
  If the game company component data is valid:
    Hide the game company feedback message
  else:
    Show the game company feedback message (Please provide the name of the company)
  If multi or single player component data is valid:
    Hide the multi or single player feedback message
  else:
    Show the multi or single player feedback message (Game must be multiplayer, single-player, or both)
  If the game genre component data is valid:
    Hide the game genre feedback message
  else:
    Show the game genre feedback message (Please provide the genre of the game)
  If the game price component data is valid:
    Hide the game price feedback message
  else:
    Show the game price feedback message (Please provide the price of the game)
  If the minimum age rating feedback component data is valid:
    Hide the minimum age rating feedback message
  else:
    Show the minimum age rating feedback message (Please provide the minimum age rating for the game)
  If the form data is valid (all of the components have valid inputs/no error messages):
    Send data(all of the inputs) to the server and store the values in the database
  else:
    Do not submit the form/send the form to the server/do not store the values of the form into the database
```


Assembling SQL queries - When I am using filtering/searching I am going to store the express in $sql_selection_query:
```
Getting all of the games to display on the table:
SELECT (...all of the fields...) FROM games + "WHERE" + $sql_selection_query;
```


Assembling SQL queries - When there are no filtering/searching applied:
```
Getting all of the games to display on the table:
SELECT (...all of the fields...) FROM games
```


Psuedocode for inserting entries into database:
```
$result = exec_sql_query(
    $db,
    "INSERT INTO games ( ... ) VALUES ( ... );",
    array ( ... )
    )
```


Outline of structure for establishing connection to database:
```
include_once("includes/db.php");
$db = open_sqlite_db("db/catalog.sqlite");
```


## Submission

### Audience (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the audiences. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable for your personas. Refer to the personas by name.

My website met the needs of William because he needed a place where he can scout out new games that he can play. He is teenager who has a younger brother, when he is playing games, he also need to make sure that he is playing the appropriate games because he does not want to negatively influence his younger brother, who is always watching him play games. My website met the needs to William where he wants to find the appropriate games in the sense that the games displayed on my web site all have age ratings, so that William can get a sense of which games he can and cannot play around his brother. There is also a filter bar on my web site that William can use to filter for games that have a certain age rating, so that he can more easily find the appropriate games. William also wants to find games that he can play with friends and my website meets this need of his in the sense that the filtering bar on my website allows William to filter games based on their game modes(multiplayer, single player, or both). This allows William to more easily find games that he can play with friends. Using the filter, William can also find games that are appropriate for his brother and multiplayer so that he can also play with his brother at times. Another one of William's needs is that he only has a $30 budget to spend on games, and my web site meets this need of his because there is a filter on the web site for games that are under $30. (One thing to note here is that I did not add the $30 filter because solely of Williams's needs, instead I came to realize that majority of the expensive games are at $60, and $30 is exactly half of that, so I decided to use $30 as a benchmark, and this just so happened to meet Williams needs). In general, if William does not have specific game in mind, he can scroll through the table of games and look through each record, and he just might stumble upon his next favorite game. My web site meets the needs of Kenji because Kenji works for the game advertisement team of a game company and it is his job to advertize the games for the company. Kenji is trying to increase the sales for the games that the company that he is working for is producing because if the company sees that Kenji is doing a great job, he may get a promotions and he does not risk getting fired for doing a more job. My web site meets the needs of Kenji because I have a form on my web site where Kenji can add the game to the table of games on my web site. Users will come on my website and stumble upon the game(s) that Kenji has listed on my web site and these users are all potential players of the games that Kenji has listed. Through my web site, Kenji is able to advertize the games for the company that he is working for, because gamers(users half of the audience for my web site) come to my web site to look for new games to play. The form that I have on my web site to add a new record to the table of games meets the needs of Kenji, because through the form Kenji can fill out information about the game that he is advertizing (game title, game company, multi/single player, genre, price, age rating). Through looking at the table of games, gamers can get a first impression of the games, and if they are interested in the games, they will go and download the games. This is a win-win situation in the sense that users like William will find new games to explore, and users like Kenji meets the goal of their jobs (which is to advertize games to new audience).

### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.

Talk about having to decide between creating the filter using either "and" or "or" because I could not decided what made more sense, but in the end of the day, I decided that it would make more sense using "and" because when users are looking for games, Williams and users like him tend to want to get more and more narrow instead of getting more and more broad. I made the games that are multiplayer and single player and both separate because users have different types of games that they want to look for. Users who select multiplayer and single player in the filter will not end up with games that have both modes, because they are logically saying they want games that exclusively have single player and exclusively have multiplayer, and thus choosing both will not result in games that have both modes. I have included a single selector where the users can pick that they want games that have both types of game modes. I decided to make my table header sticky because as the people who work for games companies add in more games, it is going to be a usability issue if the user need to score all the way back to the top to see what information is displayed in each column (Professor Harms taught us about this in class). I also added the feature that if the user is search for nothing or just spaces, then I should just return the entire database, because that way the user will be seeing useful information. I also added the feature of making the logo of the website into a link, so that if users need to reset, then can always just choose to just click on the logo, instead of having to type out the entire link again. This would also allow users to not have to clear their sticky inputs. Also a lot of websites nowadays support the feature of clicking on the "logo" and that was another reason why I added this effect. William is coming to my website so that he can stumble upon new games that he can play. My web site's purpose is to give gamers (half of the audience for my website) a first impression of games, and this means that when William and users like him come onto my website, they no not necessarily have games in mind that they are looking for (they are not looking up specific information about specific games), instead they are just trying to stumble upon interesting new games. This means that specifically for my web site, filtering is more useful than sorting for my users because the randomness in not sorted records(random game advertisers would come to my website to add games, and in a sense there is a randomness to it, because it is not predicable when and which companies representative will come to my website and add a game) increase the chances in which users are encountering random games. It does not make any sense for my web site to have sorting because I want to increase the chances that my users like William can stumble upon random games. Through my web site, William and others are trying to discover new games, and randomness is key to increasing the chances at which these users find new games. Instead of using sorting, I have the filter on my website, because using the filter, if William and other users like him have an vague idea of the types of games that they are trying to explore (such as multiplayer games to play with friends or single player games to just play by himself), they can use the filter to narrow down the long list. There will still be randomness using filtering, but the list will just get shorter. For the filter, I have decided to have multiple age section to filter by, because the audience of my web site are gamers and I explained above that there are no specific age limit for gamers because anyone at any age can decided to pick up a game and play the game. When older siblings or parents who are shopping for games for their kids come to my website, they may use these filters to filter the appropriate games for their younger siblings/children. These children can span a wide age range, and I based my division of ages on the youth development model. According to the youth development model, early adolescence is around 10-13 years old, and thus I have a filter for 14 year olds and younger. According to the model, Mid-adolescence ius around 14-18 years old, and thus I have a filter for younger than 18 years old. After mid-adolescence, there is late adolescence and adulthood, and thus I also have a label for 18 year olds and older. The reason for why I have a label for 10 year olds and younger, and also for 6 year olds and younger is because a lot more of the younger kids in the contemporary world are playing games because they have become so accessible,. A filter for 6 year olds and younger is sort of a filter that someone can click on to find games that are rated for all ages, because games that have ratings for 6 year old and younger generally tend to be very clean games. The rating for 10 year olds and younger is a rating that I have included for children that have yet reach their early adolescence, but they are still young children. Games have a huge impact on the youth, and we do not want to negatively influence our youth because we did not filter the age ratings correctly when consumers are buying games, thus I have all of the age rating filters on my website. A wide age spectrum of game in the main reason that prompt for me to include a multitude of age ratings filter on my web site. One feature of my filter that I would like to explain is that the filters in my web site gets narrower, because a trend that I saw with other websites is that when users apply many filter, the search result gets narrower and narrower, because those filters are inclusive (using the "and" logical operator instead of the "or" logical operator). In my website when a user applies many filters, only games that contain all of those criteria will be displayed. This in turn means that if a user clicks on multiplayer(exclusive) and single player(exclusive), no results will show up, because no games can be exclusively single player and multiplayer. This is also the reason for why I added a multi and single player filter, so that William and others can use that filter if they want to finds games that support inclusively single player and multiplayer games. Going to the age filters, the same logic apply. If the user clicks on many age filters, only the games that are smaller than the smallest filter will be displayed. This means that if William selects filter for "Younger than 18", "14 and younger", "10 and younger", and "6 and younger", only the games that are 6 and younger will be displayed, because it is a "and" logical. You want to display the games will the smallest filter. This makes sense for my web site, because if a parent is filtering for games and they forgot to remove the filter for games that are 14 year olds and younger, after they have finished looking up games for their 14 year old, and they now click on the filter for 10 year olds and younger because they also need to look for games for their 9 year old, they don't need to manually remove the other filtering to find only games that are appropriate for their 9 year olds because the filters returns all of the games that are for younger than 10 year olds. This filtering example in a sense represents conditional statements, because in a sense it is saying, given all of the games that are for 14 year olds and younger, I would like to select the games that are for 10 year olds and younger, thus effectively shrinking the range of games. One thing to note is that this and logical will cause no results to be shown when William and users like him select games that are both "18 and older" and "Younger than 18", because this is effectively picking a two way street. These two are mutually exclusive event and it thus makes sense that no results are returned if both of these filters are clicked on, because there are no games that are for younger than 18 year olds and at the same time for older than 18 year olds. Any other two way filters, means any of the "younger than" filters that are combined with the "older than" filter will provide no results because of the mutually exclusive logic that I have explained. I also included the phrase "and younger"/"and older" after the age limit filters because this way the users only have to click on one filter and that filter will use the age that they have selected as a upper/lower bound. If William and users like him are looking for games regardless of their age limit, then they will just not click on any of the age filters. I also decided to not make my header into a partial because I have the search bar in my header and the search bar would not be appropriate for my 404 not found page, which is the only other webpage that I have. I create a footer partial, because I realized that the footer are both on my home page and on the 404 not found page.

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What things did you have trouble with?

First off, there are a lot of things that I learned during this assignment. One of the first things that I learned during this assignment is how to use PHP code to modify my database. I learned that I could populate new records into my database through the use of form, rather than having to manually go into DB browser for SQLite to enter in a new record. I also learned how to create a simple search bar for my web site. Mainly, I learned that there are a lot of other uses for forms, other than for just taking in user input and recording that somewhere. Professor Harms taught me that forms can be used to implement filtering and sorting. Another thing that I learned during this assignment was how to properly use tables. Before this assignment I had never used tables in my website, and it was only during this project that I had gotten exposure to using tables on my web site. Through using tables, I learned how I could populate my table with information from my database. The general design of tables was something that I had never though about before doing this assignment. Although I had used and seem tables throughout my entire life, I had never thought about the alignment, proximity, spacing, and other aspects of tables that make them appear more usable. I have always looked at tables and felt different ways about different tables because of the level of difficulty that I have had with analyzing each table, but I was never able to put those struggles into words until Professor Harms thoroughly explained the usability of tables. I improve from Project 1 in the sense that it is through this assignment that I felt that I have gotten a lot better with writing code in PHP. I feel that because of all of the trials and errors that I experienced through completing this project, I have a better understanding of PHP and how I can go about debugging my code when I run into trouble. I did not have a lot of trouble in terms of debugging during project 1, so I did not really gain a lot of experience with debugging during project 1, but during this assignment, I was constantly debugging, and all that practice really helped me become better at debugging compared to project 1. I had a lot of trouble debugging the filtering and searching parts of my web site for this assignment. I thought that I understood the material pretty well from lab and Professor Harms' module videos, but when it came to actually implementing everything, I realized that I was constantly running into trouble. It was through all of the trouble that I had to go through that I was able to become better at conceptually understanding how to create a filter and search bar. For my form, the reason why I have decided that the name component should return a error message is the user enters a game name that is already in the table is because game names should be unique. There are no two game names that are the same. Games names are also trademarked, so there is a lot of legal implications behind having games with the same name, so I made the form component such that no two games in the table of games can have the same name.


### Grading: Mobile or Desktop (Final Submission)
> When we grade your final site, should we grade this with a mobile screen size or a desktop screen size?

Desktop screen size please.


### Grading: Partials (Final Submission)
> We will only grade the pages with the catalog.
> Please specify all URLs for the catalog (search, insert, view, etc.)

- <https://localhost:3000/>
My web site is only one page, because it is a catalog that contains basic information about games. My single page web site contains searching, inserting, viewing, and filtering.
